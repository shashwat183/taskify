# Taskify: Task management API

Taskify is my implementation of the standard Task Management API project.
It is implemented using nodejs and expressjs. It uses mongodb as the backend
and mongoose is used as the ODM. Unit and Integration tests are written using
mocha and chai with several mocking libraries.
